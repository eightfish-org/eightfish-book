# Features

EightFish has following highlights:

1. High performance. EightFish put user experience as the first level target, it has been optimized on all aspects to achieve this taget.
3. Low latency. EightFish makes it to get consensus result in upto 2 seconds.
2. Fully on-chain actions. EightFish use blockchain to keep the openness of the data mandatory, all actions are related to on-chain storage or checking.
2. Powerful off-chain abilities. EightFish has a full-fledged off-chain worker outside of the blockchain node, it can perform general computation, although some limitations applied.
4. Powerful query ability. EightFish grants you the ability to use query statement of SQL out of box, which is far beyond the schemes supplied by current mainstream Web3 tech stack (e.g. Eth + The Graph). The query result will be returned in dozens of ms, after the internal validation. 
5. An easy Web CRUD interface for programmer. A traditional Web2 (or Internet) programmer would feel home at writing the code of an EightFish application, it's the same.
6. All in WebAssembly. All components are written in Rust, and compiled to WebAssembly to distributed and executed.


In addtion, an EightFish App (or Open Data App) has following extra features:

2. An EightFish App will have a sovereign network for it.
1. No token (asset) on this app platform/network, thus NO xFi for the data on this platform, and NO token incentives for validators;
3. An EightFish App is just (or better as) a layer of low level data service, with no UI, no static asset files, no higher business logic in it. It needs some form of front services connected to it to provide direct business products (data aggregations, Web UI, Phone UI, etc.) for the end user;
4. One EightFish App/network holds one application protocol, one application protocol can hold multiple products for users. Different products are connected to the same backend data service, share the same dataset among all products.
5. An EightFish application/product supports both the Web2 style account via Oauth, and the Web3 style account via cryptographic algorithm.
6. On the side of user experience, if not told, you can barely recognize it as a Web3 application. Too good to ignore.
